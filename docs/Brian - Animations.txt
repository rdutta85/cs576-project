For our animations we plan to use keyframe animations as well as physics-based animations to give our enemies and main character realistic motions. 
Some examples of animations that we plan to incorporate are animations for every time an instrument is being played, animations for the walking 
motions of the playable character, walking animations for our enemies, attacking animations for our enemies, etc.
