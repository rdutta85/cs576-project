The game will have a roguelike structure. As in all of the player's progression will reset after they die. The player will 
control a character that has a varying amount of moves that they can do. The main attack of the character will be determined 
by the music note that the player does. Players will spawn in a map and travel around attacking monsters. Monsters will drop items
that the players can use to get stronger. These items increase basic stats, such as speed, strength, etc. As time progressesd, increasingly 
stronger monsters will start spawning. At any time, the  player can choose to move onto the next map. After three maps, the player 
will fight a end boss with the loot they have gathered.
