\maketitle

\paragraph*{Game description.}
Describe the game you plan to implement briefly. What is the idea? What are its key elements? What is its goal (or goals)? What are the educational components? What is the target audience?  \ Are you planning to use Unity or Unreal? Please also write a few sentences  for the following components:


\begin{itemize}
\item What are you trying to teach through this game?

\item 3D world and characters (e.g., will it be an open/closed environment? what type of objects/entities will it contain? Will it involve one or multiple human players (i.e., networking)? Will there be any AI characters?)

\item Game mechanics (e.g., what the player(s) will do? How does the environment change or what other entities do in response to the playerâ€™'s actions?)

\item Animation (e.g., will you use physics-based animation, rigid body simulation, hard-coded animations, keyframe animations, etc?)
\item User interface and sound (will the game have any menus? what input devices/sensors do you plan to use? Will it work on a mobile phone? Will there be any sound effects?)
\end{itemize}

If you want to show any images (e.g., sketches, screenshots, etc) to explain your plan better, you are more than welcome to do so! Anything that will help me understand what you are planning to do will be useful.  


\paragraph{Split of the work.}
Provide  a rough breakdown of the tasks each group member will focus on. You do not need to include this paragraph if you do not plan to work in groups.
